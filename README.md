# Right Click `Copy Text from Image`
A macOS "right click" Automator service that OCRs an image and copies the text to your clipboard.

## Usage
Once installed you can right click images with text in them, then, at the bottom, either under `Services` alone, there will be a `Copy Text from Image` option in the context menu. Clicking this option will run the service and copy any readable text in the image to your clipboard.

## Installation
- Install tesseract (`brew install tesseract`)
- Double click the `Copy Text from Image.workflow` and install from the prompt.
